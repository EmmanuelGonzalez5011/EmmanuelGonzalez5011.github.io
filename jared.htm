<h1>Jared Sullinger</h1>
<p><IMG SRC="js2.png" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="250" BORDER="0" ALT="" align="right">The Boston Celtics are a National Basketball Association (NBA) team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Confrence. Founded in 1946, the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC.</p>
				
<P>After averaging 14.4 points and 8.1 rebounds per game up until the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend, Sullinger was ruled out indefinitely after X-rays on February 19 revealed a stress reaction in his left foot.[19] Three days later, he was ruled out for the rest of the season after further medical evaluation determined that Sullinger had sustained a left metatarsal stress fracture.[20] However, in a surprising move, Sullinger returned to action on April 3 against the Milwaukee Bucks. He entered the game four minutes into the third quarter, missed both his shots and didn't return as part of a gradual effort to improve his stamina.</p>
				
<P>Sullinger began the 2015–16 season coming off the bench for the first three games. He started his first game of the season on November 4 against the Indiana Pacers, replacing Tyler Zeller as the starting center.[22] On December 7, 2015, Sullinger scored 11 points and tied a career high with 20 rebounds in a 111–93 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.[23][24] On February 7, 2016, he tied his season high with 21 points in a 128–119 win over the Sacramento Kings.[25]
 On June 29, 2016, the Celtics tendered a qualifying offer to make Sullinger a restricted free agent. The Celtics later withdrew their qualifying offer on July 8, making him an unrestricted free agent.</p>
