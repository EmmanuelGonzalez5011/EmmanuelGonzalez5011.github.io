<h1>Kelly Olynyk</h1>
<p><IMG SRC="k.png" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="250" BORDER="0" ALT="" align="right">The Boston Celtics are a National Basketball Association (NBA) team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Confrence. Founded in 1946, the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC.</p>
				
<P>On October 29, 2014, the Celtics exercised their third-year team option on Olynyk's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season.[11] On December 15, 2014, he scored a career-high 30 points in a 105–87 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[12] On January 22, 2015, he injured his ankle after landing on the foot of Thomas Robinson in the fourth quarter of the Celtics' 90–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. After being projected to return soon after the All-Star break, Olynyk didn't show signs of being ready to return, and subsequently missed 18 games. He returned to action on March 4 against the Utah Jazz.</p>
				
<P>Olynyk missed the Celtics' 2015–16 season opener against the Philadelphia 76ers on October 28 after being suspended for his role in Kevin Love's left shoulder injury during the 2015 playoffs.[14] Two days later, the Celtics exercised their fourth-year team option on Olynyk's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season.[15] On December 11, 2015, he scored a season-high 28 points in a 124–119 double overtime loss to the Golden State Warriors.[16] On March 16, 2016, he returned to action for the Celtics after missing the previous 12 games with an injured right shoulder.</p>

<p>Olynyk missed the first six games of the 2016–17 season after undergoing right shoulder surgery in May 2016, and subsequently spent a day with the Maine Red Claws of the NBA Development League in early November.[18] He made his season debut for the Celtics on November 9, 2016, playing 25 minutes and scoring two points in a 118–93 loss to the Washington Wizards.</p>
