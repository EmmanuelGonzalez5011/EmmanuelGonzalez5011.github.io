<h1>Avery Bradley</h1>
<p><IMG SRC="avepng.png" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="250" BORDER="0" ALT="" align="right">The Boston Celtics are a National Basketball Association (NBA) team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Confrence. Founded in 1946, the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC.</p>
				
<P>Bradley was selected with the 19th overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. On July 2, 2010, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Celtics.[11] The same day, he underwent successful ankle surgery and subsequently missed the 2010 NBA Summer League.</p>
				
<P>Bradley and the Celtics both continued to improve in 2016–17. Beginning with an opening night 17-point performance that included 3 of 4 three-point shooting, Bradley enjoyed his most effective offensive season, although injuries limited him to just 55 games. Starting every game he played, Bradley was remarkably consistent, with double digit scoring in 50 of his 55 regular season contests.[54] At his best, he was an outstanding weapon from three-point range. In the Celtics' third game of the season, for instance, Bradley scored 31 points on a career-high eight three-pointers, also managing 11 rebounds, as the Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets.[55] Bradley's season scoring average of 16.3 points per game was a career high, while his 39.0 three-point percentage was his best since 2013–14. His rebounding totals, meanwhile, saw a dramatic leap, as he averaged 6.1 for the season, nearly double what he ever had before.</p>

<p>he season was a success for the Celtics, with 53 wins earning them the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.[58] However, in the first round of the postseason, the Celtics initially struggled and fell behind the eighth-seeded Chicago Bulls 2–0. When they managed to win the series in six games, it marked Bradley and the team's first postseason series win since 2012.</p>
