<h1>Home of the 2008 NBA Champs!</h1>
<p><IMG SRC="celtics.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="250" BORDER="0" ALT="" align="right">The Boston Celtics are a National Basketball Association (NBA) team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Confrence. Founded in 1946, the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC.</p>
				
<P>The celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the Boston Bruins of the NHL. The Celtics'17 NBA Championships are the most for any NBA franchise, with their Western Confrence rival, the Los Angeles Lakers, following behind with 16 NBA titles. From 1957 to 1969, the Celtics dominated the league, winning 11 championships in 13 years, and eight in a row (1959-1966), the longest consecutive championship streak of any North American pro sprts team.</p>
				
<P>IN the NBA Finals, the Celtics faced the Lakers for the 11th time. The Celtics won the series in six games, along the way added several key moments such as Paul Pierce's return from a knee injury in game 1. Game 4's s4-point comeback, and Game 6's 39-point demolition, the latter still the largest margin of victory in a championship clincher.</p>

<p>The win in game 6 was a sense of relief, as it was a dificult path to this championship, in that game, these Celtics set a record for most games a team ever played in a postseason, with 26, surpasing the 1994 New York Nicks, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in 1994, Pistons in 2005).</p>
